Once incorporated the cartridge will use a source code build of the latest trunk.\r\n\r\n### Tika Server Usage\r\n\r\nIf you would like to try out the Apache Tika JAXRS server you can find a deployed instance using this cartridge at:\r\n\t\r\n\thttp://tikaserver-categorize.rhcloud.com/\r\n\r\nTo extract the contents of a file, you can use the following:\r\n\r\n\tcurl -T <file> http://tikaserver-categorize.rhcloud.com/tika\r\n\r\nTo extract the metadata of a file, you can use the following:\r\n\r\n\tcurl -T <file> http://tikaserver-categorize.rhcloud.com/tika\r\n\r\nYou can read more about the TIKA JAXRS server and it's commands [here](http://wiki.apache.org/tika/TikaJAXRS).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nThis cartridge is provided provided \"as is\", with absolutely no warranty expressed or implied.
